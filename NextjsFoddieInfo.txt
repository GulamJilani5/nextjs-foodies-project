### <img/> TAG
import logoImg  from '@/assets/logo.png';
src = {logoImg.src}, Nextjs assumed that imported image object has src attribute 
          which basically has reference  of the image/logo
<img src={logoImg.src} alt='A plate with food on it'/>

##Nextjs has build-in optimized, lazy loading and quite responsive Image tag.
here src = {logoImg.src} is not required. priority tag image shouold be in the page.
<Image src={logoImg} alt='A plate with food on it' priority/>

### Image slide show - Images are showing after every 5 seconds.
    done with the help of useEffect and setInterval()

### Sqlite DB
npm install better-sqlite3

node initdb.js

### key and list returning with map function
I was not including return of the <li> element and it was not showing anything on the screen
return (
      <ul className={classes.meals}>
         {
          meals.map((meal) => {
            return (
               <li key={meal.id}>
                 <MealItem {...meal}/>
               </li>
             )
          })
         }
      </ul>
    )

### Nextjs has it's own loading component. But we have placed that loading with react's Suspense component.
    I have placed loading-out.js inside app/meals folder just for learning understaning.
    loading has been used with Suspense fallback inside app/meals/page.js page.
    We have placed only the content that is coming from database into Suspense fallback not entire
    MealsPage.

  ## error page
  ## not-found page
### notFound
 It stop the current component execution and display the closest(by file/folder path) error or not-foun
 component

 ### Input Image Picker
